# **App Name**: Reactive Rock Paper Scissors

## Core Features:

- Live Video Stream: Capture and stream the user's hand movements in real-time using the Gemini Live API.
- AI Gesture Prediction: Use AI to predict the user's hand gesture (rock, paper, or scissors) based on the live video stream, considering acceleration and velocity.
- Persona Chatbot: Integrate a chatbot persona that provides real-time coaching and commentary during gameplay, using audio output through the Live API.
- Qualimetric Analysis: Calculate the 'Fluidity Score' to measure the synchronization between the user's action and the AI's response, displaying the score in real-time.
- Game Logic: Implement the core rock-paper-scissors game logic, including determining the winner and updating the score.
- Reflex Snapshots: Use a 'tool' leveraging the Live API's backchannel to push 'Reflex Snapshots' to a Firebase backend, adapting the AI to the user's unique rhythm, without interrupting gameplay.
